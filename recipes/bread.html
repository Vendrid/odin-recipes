    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sourdough bread is a timeless, artisan loaf known for its distinctive tangy flavor and chewy texture. Made through a natural fermentation process, it uses wild yeast and lactic acid bacteria instead of commercial yeast, giving it a deeper, more complex taste. The result is a crusty, golden-brown exterior with a soft, airy interior full of irregular holes. The tanginess comes from the lactic acid produced by the bacteria, which also contributes to its slightly sour flavor profile. Perfect for sandwiches, toast, or served alongside a hearty soup, sourdough is a versatile and flavorful choice for bread lovers.</p>
